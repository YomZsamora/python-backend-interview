# Python-Backend-Interview

Amitruck and its partners want to start recording trip details in its MySQL database. In order yo achieve that, Amitruck decided to build a service composed of APIs to help AmiTruck and its partners achieve the goal of capturing trip details

## Description
The Service must be composed of one API that logs trip details via an HTTP URL.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.9 (Django Rest Framework)
- Coverage for measuring code coverage
- Docker

## Setup Instructions and Installation

- Clone this repository to a location in your file system. `git clone https://github.com/YomZsamora/python-backend-interview.git`
- Create a virtual environment `python -m venv venv` then activate with `source venv/bin/activate `
- Read the requirements file and Install all the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Setup a MySQL Database engine. Open settings.py and change declaration of the DB_NAME, DB_USER & DB_PASSWORD
    - Can hide sensitive information by using `python-decouple 3.6` to store variables in an .env file
- Ensure MySQL Server is up and running then log into MySQL with a database user/role `mysql -u <user> -p`
    - You'll be prompted to enter a password for this user
- Next, create the database `CREATE DATABASE <dbname>` then connect to the database via `use <dbname>`
- We can now migrate using: `python manage.py migrate`
- Create a user in the terminal using command: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
    - You'll be prompted to provide username, email and password
- Now letâ€™s start the development server and explore it: `python manage.py runserver` then Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin/` on your browser.

##### Setting Up Docker
   * Build Image and Run Container:

    docker-compose build
    docker-compose run --rm app django-admin startproject amitruck_assessment .
    docker-compose up

##### Importing MySQL database in Docker
   * This is a simple way of importing MySQL database in Docker:

    1. Download mysqldump from command line: `mysqldump -u user -p db_name > db_backup.sql`
    2. Put the exported sql file in the shared folder.
    3. Login to your Docker instance via `docker exec -it DOCKER_CONTAINER_ID bin/bash`
    4. Login to MySQL via mysql -u user -p.
    5. While in MySQL CLI, create a database via `create database DB_NAME;`
    6. While in MySQL CLI, use the database you just created via `use DB_NAME;`
    7. While in MySQL CLI, import the sql file via `docker exec -i container_name mysql -uroot dbname < db_backup.sql;`
